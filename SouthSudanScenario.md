# Examining precipitation data

**Question 1a:** What is the precipitation forecast for the 2017 growing season in the Pongo Basin area?

**Question 1b**: How does the precipitation forecast compare with historical precipitation data for the 2017 growing season in the Pongo Basin area?

**Question 1c**: What would the precipitation prediction be if we assume a 60% increase over normal conditions in the Pongo Basin area?
